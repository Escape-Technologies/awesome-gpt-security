## Tools

ðŸ§° 

### Audit

* [SourceGPT](https://github.com/NightmareLab/SourceGPT) - prompt manager and source code analyzer built on top of ChatGPT as the oracle
* [ChatGPTScanner](https://github.com/YulinSec/ChatGPTScanner) - A white box code scan powered by ChatGPT
* [chatgpt-code-analyzer](https://github.com/MilindPurswani/chatgpt-code-analyzer) - ChatGPT Code Analyzer for Visual Studio Code
* [hacker-ai](https://hacker-ai.ai/#hacker-ai) - An online tool using AI to detect vulnerabilities in source code

### Reconnaissance

* [GPT_Vuln-analyzer](https://github.com/morpheuslord/GPT_Vuln-analyzer) - Uses ChatGPT API, Python-Nmap, DNS Recon modules and uses the GPT3 model to create vulnerability reports based on Nmap scan data, and DNS scan information. It can also perform subdomain enumeration to a great extent
* [SubGPT](https://github.com/s0md3v/SubGPT) - SubGPT looks at subdomains you have already discovered for a domain and uses BingGPT to find more.
* [Navi](https://github.com/SSGOrg/Navi) - A QA based Reconnaissance Tool with GPT

### Offensive

* [burpgpt](https://github.com/aress31/burpgpt) - A Burp Suite extension that integrates OpenAI's GPT to perform an additional passive scan for discovering highly bespoke vulnerabilities, and enables running traffic-based analysis of any type.
* [ReconAIzer](https://github.com/hisxo/ReconAIzer) - A Burp Suite extension to add OpenAI (GPT) on Burp and help you with your Bug Bounty recon to discover endpoints, params, URLs, subdomains and more!
* [PassGAN](https://github.com/brannondorsey/PassGAN) - A Deep Learning Approach for Password Guessing. [HomeSecurityHeroes land a Product](https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/ai-password-cracking/), and you can test how much time an AI would need to crack your password here.

### Detecting

* [k8sgpt](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt/) - a tool for scanning your Kubernetes clusters, diagnosing, and triaging issues in simple English.
* [cloudgpt](https://github.com/ustayready/cloudgpt) - Vulnerability scanner for AWS customer managed policies using ChatGPT
* [IATelligence](https://github.com/fr0gger/IATelligence) - About
IATelligence is a Python script that will extract the IAT of a PE file and request GPT to get more information about the API and the ATT&CK matrix related

### Preventing

### Social Engineering

* [ChatGPT-Web-Setting-Funny-Abuse](https://github.com/Esonhugh/ChatGPT-Web-Setting-Funny-Abuse) - Play with ChatGPT-Web and found the HTML rendering in description settings.

### Reverse Engineering
